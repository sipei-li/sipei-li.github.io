                    <ul class="project">
                        <li>Wrote an interpreter for a small object-oriented programming language called Rube,
                             which is a simplified version of Ruby.</li>
                        <li>Implemented object-oriented features including class definitions, class inheritance, object
                            creations and method invocations.</li>
                        <li>Implemented basic expressions including assignments to local variables and fields,

                        <li>Implemented built-in methods and classes of integers, strings and objects.</li>
                        <li>Included a type-checker for the language, allowing the interpreter to type check the types of
                            objects, methods and expressions before running the program and to bring up error messages
                            as early as possible.</li>
